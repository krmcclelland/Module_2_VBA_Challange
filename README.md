# VBA Challange

## Background:
The client is interested in investing in green stocks and has been monitoring the stock market for a stock called DQ but needs to analyze other green stocks for the past two years to ensure it is the best stock for their investment dollars.  The client provided a list of twelve (12) stocks to review captured on a spreadsheet.  To continue our evaluation, we also need to refactor or index the code to speed up the code's run time.

## Analysis Results: 
There was a significant contrast between 2017 over 2018.  By far, 2017 was a better year for these green stocks.  DQ showed positive returns of 199.4% in 2017, wherein 2018 had negative returns of (62.6%), and with a swing of (262%) it would not be the best investment for a conservative investor.  Their performance in 2017 are as follows:

To use the VBA code to analyze future investments, we have refactored or indexed the code to reduce the time it takes to analyze investment to react faster to investment opportunities. In addition, we inserted code to monitor the time it takes to run the code below shows the before and after the code is indexed.  The run time figures below on the left are before the indexing, and the right is after the indexing.

## Conclusion:
As seen above, there are two potential green investments to consider ENPH and RUN, as they produced better returns than DQ for a conservative investor.
